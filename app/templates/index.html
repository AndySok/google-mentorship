                The medication aspect of the website is the core of the project. We have two primary users: elderly and caretakers. The user can input information about current medications that they take, including information about dosage, times of the day to take a specified medication, and how many pills are in each prescription before a new medication needs to be issued. To begin interacting with this information, click on the "Medication" page on the navigation bar.

                The AI component of the website aims to increase ease of navigating the website. It is available in two different formats: a chat bot, where you can interact directly and get help with any possible questions about the program, as well as in a voice automated button, that is comparable to that of Alexa but has more of a focus on helping senior citizens in particular and can allow users to upload their medication information this way rather than through typing it in.
