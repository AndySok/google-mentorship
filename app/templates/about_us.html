Andrey: As of right now, I’ve used React and NextJS for building websites in the past, and I am currently in the process of getting to know Java as part of APCS and TypeScript for a potential Stuyvesant Spectator website rewrite. On the back-end side of the spectrum, I’ve used Rails on Rails connected to PostgreSQL, although I am currently trying to figure out MongoDB and its advantages over other database frameworks. As part of specweb, I’ve had experience in using AWS for hosting and Google Analytics for collecting data. Much like Vernon, I am also part of ARISTA’s Web Dev Committee, and we are currently in the process of reorganizing the ARISTA Application portal, making it more stable and less disorganized.
